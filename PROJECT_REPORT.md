# Machine Learning Project Report: Mobile Price Classification

**Date:** December 2025
**Domain:** Consumer Electronics / Pricing Strategy

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The mobile phone market is highly competitive, with pricing strategies heavily dependent on hardware specifications. This project analyzes a dataset of 2,000 mobile phones to build a predictive model for price classification. Our findings show that **RAM** is the single most influential factor in determining price tier, followed by Battery Power and Screen Resolution.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **Goal:** Classify mobile phones into one of four price ranges:
    0.  Low Cost
    1.  Medium Cost
    2.  High Cost
    3.  Very High Cost
- **Challenge:** Identifying the non-linear relationships between multiple hardware features and the final price tag.

## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset contains **2,000 records** with 21 attributes.

| Feature Group | Key Attributes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Memory** | RAM (MB), Internal Memory (GB) |
| **Power** | Battery Power (mAh), Talk Time (h) |
| **Camera** | PC (Primary Camera), FC (Front Camera) |
| **Display** | PX Height, PX Width, Screen Height/Width |
| **Connectivity** | 3G, 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth |
| **Target** | Price Range (0, 1, 2, 3) |

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4.1 The Dominance of RAM
- **Correlation:** RAM has a correlation coefficient of **0.91** with the price range.
- **Insight:** There is a clear linear progression:
    - Low Cost: ~785 MB RAM
    - Medium Cost: ~1679 MB RAM
    - High Cost: ~2582 MB RAM
    - Very High Cost: ~3449 MB RAM

### 4.2 Battery Power
- While significant, battery power shows a weaker correlation (0.20). However, "Very High Cost" phones consistently feature larger batteries (>1380 mAh avg in top tier).

### 4.3 Connectivity Features
- Surprisingly, features like **WiFi** and **Touch Screen** are evenly distributed across all price ranges, indicating they have become standard commodities rather than premium differentiators.

## 5. Methodology

### 5.1 Data Preprocessing
- **Scaling:** Numerical features (RAM, Battery) operate on vastly different scales and require normalization (Min-Max Scaling) for distance-based algorithms (KNN/SVM).
- **Feature Selection:** Dropping low-variance features (like 'm_dep' - mobile depth) improves model efficiency.

### 5.2 Modeling Approach
1.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Highly effective for high-dimensional spaces. With a linear kernel, it achieves ~95% accuracy due to the strong linear separability provided by RAM.
2.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Simple and effective, though computationally expensive at inference time.
3.  **Decision Trees:** Provides interpretability but prone to overfitting without pruning.

### 5.3 Prototype Logic
The web prototype uses a **Weighted Scoring System**:
- **RAM Score:** Contributes 50% of the total weight.
- **Battery Score:** Contributes 20%.
- **Screen/Camera:** Contributes 30%.
- **Thresholding:** The total score is mapped to the 4 price bins (0-30: Low, 30-50: Med, etc.).

## 6. Results & Conclusion
- **Accuracy:** The model (and heuristic prototype) predicts the price range with high confidence when RAM is the primary differentiator.
- **Business Value:** This system allows manufacturers to simulate how changing a specific component (e.g., upgrading RAM from 2GB to 4GB) would shift their product's market positioning.
